## Understanding the Difference

Epoxy and polyurethane are both thermoset polymers used in flooring, but their chemistry gives them distinct performance characteristics.

### Epoxy Systems

Epoxy resins are formed by reacting epoxide groups with a hardener (typically amines or polyamides). The result is a rigid, hard surface with excellent:

- **Chemical resistance** — Resists acids, alkalis, solvents
- **Compressive strength** — 80+ MPa
- **Adhesion** — Bonds mechanically and chemically to concrete
- **Cost** — Generally lower than polyurethane

However, epoxy has limitations:

- **UV sensitivity** — Yellows and chalks with UV exposure
- **Flexibility** — Rigid, can crack with substrate movement
- **Thermal shock** — Limited tolerance for rapid temperature changes

### Polyurethane Systems

Polyurethane chemistry offers more flexibility in formulation, resulting in:

- **UV stability** — Aliphatic PU doesn't yellow
- **Flexibility** — Bridges hairline cracks
- **Abrasion resistance** — Superior wear resistance
- **Thermal tolerance** — Better performance under thermal cycling

Trade-offs include:

- **Cost** — Higher material cost
- **Moisture sensitivity** — During cure, more sensitive to humidity
- **Chemical resistance** — Generally lower than epoxy

## When to Use Each

### Choose Epoxy When:

1. Budget is a primary concern
2. Indoor application with no UV exposure
3. Heavy chemical exposure expected
4. Maximum hardness required

### Choose Polyurethane When:

1. UV exposure is unavoidable (exterior, skylights)
2. High abrasion/traffic expected
3. Some substrate movement anticipated
4. Premium finish quality required

## The Hybrid Approach

Many projects benefit from combining both technologies:

- **Epoxy base coat** — For adhesion and chemical resistance
- **Polyurethane topcoat** — For UV stability and wear resistance

This gives you the best of both worlds at a moderate cost premium.

## Conclusion

There's no universally "better" system — the right choice depends on your specific environment, performance requirements, and budget. We're happy to assess your project and recommend the optimal solution.
