## The Foundation of Every Floor

Ask any experienced flooring contractor about the most critical phase of installation, and they'll tell you: preparation. A beautiful topcoat over poorly prepared concrete is a failure waiting to happen.

## Common Preparation Methods

### Shot Blasting

The industry standard for most resin floors. Steel shot propelled at high velocity:

- Removes laitance and weak surface layers
- Creates ideal surface profile (CSP 3-5)
- Dust-free with vacuum recovery
- Fast coverage of large areas

### Diamond Grinding

Preferred when shot blasting isn't suitable:

- Lower profile creation (CSP 2-3)
- Better for thin-film coatings
- Works on vertical surfaces
- Less aggressive on sound concrete

### Scarifying

For heavy contamination or thick coating removal:

- Aggressive material removal
- Creates rough profile
- Used for preparation before shot blasting
- Effective on oil-saturated concrete

## Critical Testing

### Moisture Testing

Excess moisture vapor is the enemy of resin floors. We test using:

- **Calcium chloride test** (ASTM F1869) — Surface moisture
- **RH probe test** (ASTM F2170) — Internal humidity

Acceptable levels:
- Calcium chloride: ≤3 lbs/1000 ft²/24 hrs
- RH: ≤75%

### Adhesion Testing

Pull-off testing (ASTM D4541) verifies substrate will hold the coating:

- Minimum 1.5 MPa for most systems
- 2.0+ MPa preferred for heavy-duty applications

## What Happens Without Proper Prep

1. **Delamination** — Coating separates from substrate
2. **Blistering** — Moisture vapor pushes through coating
3. **Peeling** — Edge failure and coating lift
4. **Premature wear** — Coating wears through to substrate

## Our Process

Every Floor.DSGN project includes:

1. Site assessment and testing
2. Written preparation specification
3. Documentation of completed prep
4. Adhesion testing before coating

We don't cut corners on preparation — it's not visible in the finished floor, but it's the difference between a 3-year floor and a 15-year floor.
