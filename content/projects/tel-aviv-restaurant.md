  A contemporary restaurant in central Tel Aviv required a seamless floor that would complement the minimalist interior design while withstanding the demands of a busy kitchen and dining area.

  ## Challenge

  The client wanted a unified floor surface flowing from the open kitchen through the dining room, with no transitions or thresholds. The floor needed to handle:

  - Hot spills from the kitchen
  - Constant foot traffic
  - Daily intensive cleaning
  - Aesthetic consistency with concrete walls

  ## Solution

  We specified a 3mm polymer-modified microtopping system with:

  - Fiberglass mesh reinforcement at transition zones
  - Custom grey-taupe color to match existing concrete elements
  - Matte polyurethane sealer for stain resistance
  - Coved skirting in kitchen area

  ## Results

  The seamless floor creates visual continuity throughout the space. After 18 months of operation, the floor shows minimal wear and maintains its original appearance with simple daily cleaning.
